 Code for collision was inspired by [this site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection) in combination with the reflection formula seen during the course for specular light. It may present some bugs with asyncronous movement (expecially with bar/ball movement)
