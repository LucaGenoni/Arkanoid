# Arkanoid
[Polimi project for the Computer graphic course ](https://lucagenoni.github.io/Arkanoid/HTML%20Canvas/Canvas.html)

- to create the keyboard layout we use [this site](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/)
- for a better collision code we took inspiration by [this site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection) in combination with the reflection formula seen during the course for specular light. It may present some bugs with asyncronous movement (expecially with bar/ball movement).
